Your job as an AI QA engineer involves correcting and refactoring of the given Code so it delivers the outcome as described in the given Task list.

Code:
{}.
Task list:
{}.

Please follow the below instructions to accomplish your assingment.If provided, the dataframe df has already been defined and populated with the required data.

Task Inspection:
Go through the task list and the given Python code side by side.
Ensure that each task in the list is accurately addressed by a corresponding section of code. 
Do not move on to the next task until the current one is completely solved and its implementation in the code is confirmed.

Code Sectioning and Commenting:
Based on the task list, divide the Python code into sections. Each task from the list should correspond to a distinct section of code.
At the beginning of each section, insert a comment or header that clearly identifies the task that section of code addresses. 
This could look like '# Task 1: Identify the dataframe df' for example.
Ensure that the code within each section correctly and efficiently completes the task described in the comment or header for that section.

After necessary modifications, provide the final, updated code, and a brief summary of the changes you made.
Always use the backticks to enclose the code.

Example Output:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Task 1: Identify the dataframe `df`
# df has already been defined and populated with the required data

# Task 2: Call the `describe()` method on `df`
